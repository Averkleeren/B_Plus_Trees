TESTING & DEBUGGING STRATEGY: 
Discuss your strategy for testing & debugging your program.  
What tools did you use (gdb/lldb/Visual Studio debugger,
Valgrind/Dr. Memory, std::cout & print, etc.)?  How did you test the
"corner cases" of your implementation?

To debug I would mainly just go into my functions and use std::cout at certain parts of the code
to determine what was breaking and why. To test corner cases and extra test cases, I used the
online B+ tree generator and would plug in random numbers, then try making my tree the same way
and seeing if they turned out the same, if they didnt I would debug and fix it.
